# Developer Setup Guide - project-create-a-comprehensive

This guide outlines the setup process for developers working on `project-create-a-comprehensive`, a HIPAA-compliant healthcare patient portal.

## Prerequisites

- **Required Software Versions:**
    - Python 3.9+
    - Node.js 16+
    - PostgreSQL 14+ (or your preferred database, adjustments needed in config)
    - Docker & Docker Compose (for Docker option)
- **Development Tools:**
    - Git
    - Text editor or IDE (see recommendations below)
- **IDE Recommendations and Configurations:**
    - **VS Code:** Highly recommended due to its extensive extension support (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Docker, Git). Install relevant extensions for Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and PostgreSQL.
    - **PyCharm (Professional):** Excellent for Python development, with built-in debugging and testing tools.  Requires a professional license.
    - **WebStorm:**  Excellent for JavaScript/TypeScript development, with similar features to PyCharm. Requires a license.


## Local Development Setup

### Option 1: Docker Development (Recommended)

This option simplifies setup by containerizing the application and its dependencies.

1. **Clone Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd project-create-a-comprehensive
   ```

2. **Docker Setup:** Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running.  Instructions can be found on the Docker website.

3. **Development `docker-compose.yml` Configuration:**  This file (assumed to exist in the root directory) defines the services (database, backend, frontend).  Example:

   ```yaml
   version: "3.9"
   services:
     db:
       image: postgres:14
       environment:
         - POSTGRES_USER=your_db_user
         - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_db_password
         - POSTGRES_DB=your_db_name
       ports:
         - "5432:5432"
     backend:
       build: ./backend
       ports:
         - "8000:8000"
       depends_on:
         - db
       environment:
         - DATABASE_URL=postgres://your_db_user:your_db_password@db:5432/your_db_name
         # ... other environment variables
     frontend:
       build: ./frontend
       ports:
         - "3000:3000"
       depends_on:
         - backend
   ```

4. **Hot Reload Setup:**  Use tools like `nodemon` (frontend) and appropriate Python reloaders (e.g., `autoreload` in development server) for automatic restarts on code changes.  These should be integrated into the `docker-compose.yml` or start scripts.

### Option 2: Native Development

This option requires manual installation of dependencies.

1. **Backend Setup (Python):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup (Node.js):**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Database Setup:** Install PostgreSQL and create the database.  Configure connection details in your database configuration files.


## Environment Configuration

- **Required Environment Variables:**  A `.env` file (example below) should store sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, and secrets.  **Never commit `.env` to version control!**

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://your_db_user:your_db_password@localhost:5432/your_db_name
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key  # Example for billing
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid # Example for SMS
   # ... other environment variables
   ```

- **Local Development `.env` File Setup:** Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with your local development settings.

- **Configuration for Different Environments:** Use environment variables and configuration files to manage settings for different environments (development, staging, production).


## Running the Application

- **Start Commands for Development (Docker):**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

- **Start Commands for Development (Native):**
    ```bash
    #Backend
    python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 #or equivalent command for your framework

    #Frontend
    npm start
    ```


- **Access Frontend and Backend:**  Frontend will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or specified port in `docker-compose.yml` or `package.json`) and the backend API at `http://localhost:8000` (adjust as needed).

- **API Documentation Access:**  Use tools like Swagger or OpenAPI to generate and host API documentation.


## Development Workflow

- **Git Workflow and Branching Strategy:** Use Gitflow or a similar branching strategy (e.g., feature branches, develop branch, main branch).

- **Code Formatting and Linting Setup:** Use tools like `black` (Python), `prettier` (JavaScript), and `eslint` (JavaScript) to enforce consistent code style.  Integrate these into your IDE and CI/CD pipeline.

- **Testing Procedures:** Implement unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Use a testing framework like `pytest` (Python) and `Jest` (JavaScript).

- **Debugging Setup:** Use your IDE's debugging tools or command-line debuggers like `pdb` (Python) and the browser's developer tools.


## Database Management

- **Running Migrations:** Use database migration tools (e.g., Alembic for SQLAlchemy) to manage database schema changes.

- **Seeding Development Data:** Create scripts to populate the database with sample data for development.

- **Database Reset Procedures:**  Create scripts to easily reset the database to a known state.


## Testing

- **Running Unit Tests:**  Execute unit tests using your chosen testing framework (e.g., `pytest -v` for pytest).

- **Running Integration Tests:** Run integration tests to verify interactions between different components of the system.

- **Test Coverage Reports:** Generate test coverage reports to track the percentage of code covered by tests.


## Common Development Tasks

- **Adding New API Endpoints:** Follow the existing API design patterns and add new endpoints to the backend.

- **Adding New Frontend Components:** Create new React/Angular/Vue components and integrate them into the application.

- **Database Schema Changes:**  Use database migrations to manage schema changes safely and reliably.

- **Adding Dependencies:**  Use `pip` (Python) and `npm` (JavaScript) to add new dependencies.  Always update `requirements.txt` and `package.json`.


## Troubleshooting

- **Common Setup Issues:** Check Docker logs, error messages, and ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.

- **Port Conflicts Resolution:** Change ports in your configuration files if there are conflicts.

- **Dependency Issues:** Check for version conflicts and use tools like `pip-tools` (Python) to manage dependencies.

- **Environment Variable Problems:** Verify that environment variables are correctly set and accessible to the application.


## Contributing

- **Code Style Guidelines:** Adhere to the specified code style guidelines (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, Airbnb style guide for JavaScript).

- **Pull Request Process:** Create pull requests for code changes and follow the established review process.

- **Issue Reporting:** Report bugs and feature requests using the project's issue tracker.


This comprehensive guide provides a solid foundation for developers working on `project-create-a-comprehensive`. Remember to adapt it based on the specific technologies and frameworks used in your project.  Remember to thoroughly research HIPAA compliance requirements and implement appropriate security measures throughout the development process.
